DelayedResponse is a supply and storage management solution API built around Python 3.6.  
Users are able to input information about supply items as they arrive, including cost, volume, useful life, and name.  
DelayedResponse monitors supply levels, issuing an SMS alert when items are about to expire, when storage is full, and when storage 
levels approach critically low values.
The DelayedResponse API is designed to accept customer specific user interfaces, though it ships with a headless interface for 
evaluation.
The headless client does not currently allow users to change the alert cell number at runtime due to the limitations of the SMS API 
used, but they can have their numbers authorized by a DelayedResponse representative before distribution.
On running the DelayedResponse headless client, users are presented with a command line based interface to the API.
This allows users to insert items into and remove items from storage, view the items in storage, view storage and cost information,
and view information about items in storage.
